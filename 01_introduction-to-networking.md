## What is data networking

- a collection of protocols that allow us to move information from one device to
    another device (whether in the same room or on the other side of the earth)

- **networking hardware** is the device that implements the protocols that we
    use to move data around

## Understanding data networking

- sender -> data/information -> receiver

- example (moving information telephone):
    - sender (server) ->
    - message in english ("Hello")[data/information] ->
    - air ->
    - Bridge(air vibration to electrical signal) ->
    - wires (medium) ->
    - Bridge (electrical signal to air vibration) ->
    - message in english("Hello") [data/information] ->
    - receiver (client)

## Modeling Systems

- systems modeling or system modeling is the interdisciplinary study of the use
    of models to conceptualize and construct systems in business and IT
    development

- example of a modeling system
    - **concept**   (e.g. message)
    - **language**  (e.g. english)
    - **link**      (e.g. vibration)
    - **physical**  (e.g. air)
